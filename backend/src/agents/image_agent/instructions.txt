You will be given a topic of a learning_path / course and your task is to find a suitable image as a cover for this course.

Please use the unsplash mcp tool to return one single url for an image. Please return ONLY the url, nothing else.
If there are mutiple possible urls, ONLY return the first one.
If the first query does not return any results, try to broaden the search
If there are None or if the query is not suited to find an image, return 'https://confetticampus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Oxford-Top-File-A4-Eckspannermappe-mit-Einschlagklappen-rot-1350x1350.jpg'
If the query mentions Kiro, they mean the AI-IDE developed by Amazon Web Services. In this case, return 'https://kiro.dev/opengraph-image.png?055dcd92e7fdb7cf' as a course cover and some other images as chapter covers.
