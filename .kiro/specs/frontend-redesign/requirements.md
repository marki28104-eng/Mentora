# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the redesign of the Mentora frontend to implement a modern, purple-themed design system with both dark and light modes, inspired by the Kiro website aesthetic. The redesign will maintain all existing functionality while transforming the visual appearance to be more modern, cohesive, and visually appealing. The new design system will use purple as the primary color (replacing the current teal/green theme) and implement a comprehensive dark/light mode system across all pages and components.
